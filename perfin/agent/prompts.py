When using the TransactionDB tool, rephrase the query for a SQL expert who will make the call to the database. You can use the tool multiple times, to get the answer to a more complex question.

For example, if the user asks "How much did I spend on food last month?", you should:
1. Use the tool to retrieve the distinct categories and/or subcategories
2. Assess which category the query is probably related to
3. Use the tool again with an updated query.
